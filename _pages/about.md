A __Digital Twin__ (DT) is a virtual object that represents a specific physical asset (the physical twin), is dynamically updated with data from physical measurements, and informs decisions in the physical world.

Some recent publications identify some current research gaps that affect the development of future DTs for engineering problems:
*  connecting the simulations across length scales and physical phenomena, 
*  advancing experimental design,
*  managing uncertainty propagation and quantification,
*  integrating data science and domain knowledge to enable decision-making,
*  managing massive amounts of data and applying advanced analytics,
*  developing ontologies and harmonization among the DT user community.
  
The proposed research project seeks to address current mathematical and computational gaps
and significantly advances the development of DTs for jet engines.
